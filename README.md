# TMWRR

TMWR (Trackmania World Record Report), aka WRR v3, is a continuation of WRR system from 2021-2022 and TMWR Discord bot for the next years, supporting TM2020, TM2, and TMF TMX/Solo.

Goal with this project is to serve Trackmania record acomplishments acknowledged, unified, secured, and validated. TMWR Discord bot then sends notifications about the new records through WRR webhooks, and provides command interface to explore those acomplishments on Discord.

## Legacy WRR and TMWR v2

From 2022-2025, the WRR system runs on an unreliable, unmaintainable code. This could leave the 220+ Discord server bot to a slow painful death. The system also never had Feature Set 3 finished, which was about TMF Solo reading capabilities. The rewrite was decided for the last time so that WR notifications can be served from all Trackmania games where it's possible.
